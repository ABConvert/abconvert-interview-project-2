# Frontend Track

## Description

Your main role is to ensure the A/B testing feature is well-designed, user-friendly, and easily maintainable. Every component you develop should be modular and structured in a way that allows for future expansion or integration with other services. Your task is to focus on both the user experience and technical implementation of the A/B testing tool.

You should consider the following:

### Modularity & Integration:

Each function of your A/B testing tool should be modular and easy to extend. This ensures that as the feature evolves, adding new test types, variations, or integrations (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel) can be done with minimal refactoring.
The tracking component of the tool should be flexible enough to combine data from different sources (e.g., Google Analytics or custom in-house analytics).

### Feature Completeness:

Starting with the goal of optimizing page performance and improving the user journey, think through the necessary functionality to achieve the best possible user experience. This includes real-time tracking of user actions, variant assignment (A/B or multivariate), and delivering a seamless user experience across different devices.
Ensure the user interface provides clear feedback, enabling users to quickly start, stop, or evaluate an experiment.

### Performance Optimization:

Ensure that your solution does not negatively impact the page load speed. Efficient delivery of A/B variations is crucial to maintaining a smooth user experience.
Consider client-side performance metrics, such as the load time for experiment variants, and optimize the tool to minimize any delays in the user journey.
