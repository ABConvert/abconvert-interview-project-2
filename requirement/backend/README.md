# Backend Track

## Description

Your primary responsibility is to ensure that the A/B testing system can handle a large volume of traffic while maintaining accuracy and scalability. Assume that the system will track 100 different event types and will handle billions of requests daily. The backend should be designed to process this volume of data efficiently while providing real-time analytics without sacrificing performance.

You should consider the following:

### Scalability & Real-Time Processing:

The system must be capable of scaling horizontally to accommodate a high volume of requests, ensuring fast response times and accurate data collection.
Real-time analytics are critical. Ensure that your system can process and aggregate data from billions of events per day while providing actionable insights to the users with minimal delay.
Implement strategies such as event batching, message queues (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ), or stream processing (e.g., Apache Flink or Spark) to handle this volume of data efficiently.

### Data Storage & Aggregation:

Design a robust data storage solution that can handle event data at scale. You may need to consider using distributed databases (e.g., Cassandra, ClickHouse, or AWS Redshift) that are optimized for high-throughput writes and fast querying.
Ensure that data aggregation for real-time dashboards and reports is efficient, allowing users to track A/B test performance and statistical significance in near real-time.
Plan for efficient querying of both raw event data and pre-aggregated metrics, allowing users to drill down into specific tests or time frames without significant delay.

### Fault Tolerance & Accuracy:

The system must be fault-tolerant, ensuring no data is lost even under heavy load or in the case of failures. Implement strategies such as replication, failover mechanisms, and retry policies to prevent data loss.
Prioritize the accuracy of the data. Ensure that even under high traffic, events are not duplicated or lost. The integrity of the data is paramount for making accurate business decisions based on test results.
Security & Compliance:

Since the system will handle large volumes of user data, ensure that all data processing complies with security best practices and regulations like GDPR or CCPA.
Ensure that sensitive user data is handled securely, with appropriate encryption mechanisms and data access controls in place.
